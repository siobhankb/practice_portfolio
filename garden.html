            <p>Grass is a waste. California (and much of the world) is in extreme drought, so the idea of watering grass that doesn't give much back seems futile. If I'm going to use water, it's going to be to feed myself, my dog, and my community. In the 2nd year of owning my home, I was able to convert the front yard to a raised-bed garden. I used the <a href="https://squarefootgardening.org/">square foot gardening method</a> to get high-yield, low-fuss, delicious produce for much of the summer without increasing my water usage all that much. I have killed nearly every house plant I ever owned, but thanks to irrigation timers, I managed to grow an abundance of food for myself with so much left over, I had bushels of tomatoes into October.</p>
